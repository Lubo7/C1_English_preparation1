            <div class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-blue-200">
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Person A:</strong> Do you think the government is spending our tax money wisely?</p>
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Person B:</strong> Well, it's a complex issue. In the UK, pensions constitute the largest portion of public spending at about 20%, followed by health at 18%.</p>
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Person A:</strong> I didn't realize pensions were such a large part of the budget. I thought healthcare would be the biggest expense.</p>
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Person B:</strong> Many people think that. The aging population is putting a lot of pressure on public finances. The government allocates funds based on current needs, but also has to plan for future demands.</p>
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Person A:</strong> How does our spending compare to other countries?</p>
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Person B:</strong> The US, for example, spends a higher percentage on healthcare and education but a lower percentage on pensions and welfare compared to the UK. They also have a significantly larger defense budget.</p>
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Person A:</strong> I think taxpayers' money should be spent more on infrastructure and education. We're wasting money on some administrative programs that don't deliver results.</p>
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Person B:</strong> The Chancellor of the Exchequer ultimately decides how tax revenue is spent, but not before consulting with various stakeholders. It's always a balancing act between different priorities and limited resources.</p>
